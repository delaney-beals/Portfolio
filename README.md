## Projects

Here, I use the output of RNA-seq to generate volcano plots for visulazing the gene expression changes between <i>Methylomonas</i> sp. LW13 cells at different depths within the methane-oxygen counter gradient of the gradient syringe model ecosystem. I also compare the global gene expression of cells within the gradient syringe to cells cultivated in conventional planktonic culture [here](https://github.com/delaney-beals/LW13_segVplank_RNAseq).

In this project, I analyze the presence and relative expression of quorum sensing systems in mixed methane-oxidizing bacterial communities from Lake Washington. The -omics data was originally published by Zheng et al. 2020 (Metagenomic insight into environmentally challenged methane-fed microbial commmunities) and the data is publically available on the IMG JGI database under the study name "Freshwater sediment methanotrophic microbial communities from Lake Washington under simulated oxygen tension."
